# anarchic-penguins

This is a Rogue-Like Beat them up.

You play as a family of penguins which have been banished from their land by their king for the sole reason that your family cannot resist enough to the bite of the frost...
Your goal is to reclaim your place in the kingdom by taking the place of the King of the penguins with your own army

The game will be divided into two big phases:
    - A beat-them-up phase where you can switch between three (four ?) heroes (or play with your friends), and assign them a part of your army
    - A 1v1 phase against a boss to get its sympathy and a part of its army

Every time every of your heroes (or if only one ?) dies, you have to restart a run and your army dissolves.
However, by fighting again and again against the King, you will gain sympathy from the people and will be able to start with an army, or get some abilities.

There is different classes of penguins that you can play, and they will be randomly chosen at the start of each run.

The more you approach the king, the more cold will the environnement be, so be careful not to freeze in place !
Moving fast and using abilities will allow you to be warmer (and then to move faster, hit harder, etc), so you might want to combo your way through your ennemies :)

Once you defeat the king, you'll be able to become the king, but since you're now really cold resistant, you become the new king of pinguins, and your successors will now have to fight your former self
